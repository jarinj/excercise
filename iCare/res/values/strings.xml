    <string name="tvGeneralHealthInfo">Breastfeeding:

Babies eat and eat and eat. Although nature has done a pretty good job of providing you and your baby with the right equipment, in the beginning it\s almost guaranteed to be harder than you expected. From sore nipples to tough latch-ons, nursing can seem overwhelming.
1. Women who seek help have a higher success rate. "Think of ways to ensure success before you even give birth,suggests Stacey Brosnan, a lactation consultant in New York City. Talk with friends who had a good nursing experience, ask baby\s pediatrician for a lactation consultant\s number, or attend a La Leche League (nursing support group) meeting (see laleche.org to find one).
2. Use hospital resources. Kira Sexton, a Brooklyn, New York, mom, says, "I learned everything I could about breastfeeding before I left the hospital." Ask if there\s a nursing class or a lactation consultant on staff. Push the nurse-call button each time you\re ready to feed the baby, and ask a nurse to spot you and offer advice.
3. Prepare. At home, you\ll want to drop everything to feed the baby the moment she cries for you. But Heather O\Donnell, a mom in New York City, suggests taking care of yourself first. "Get a glass of water and a book or magazine to read." And, because breastfeeding can take a while, she says, "pee first!"
